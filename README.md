# Noted 2.0
Noted 2.0 is the 2nd version of my terminal note taking app written in rust.
It has been slightly improved add now features --help.

## Usage
`noted2 --help`

## How to install
Make sure that you have `Cargo` installed and run `cargo build --release`.
Your app is now inside `target/release` and is named `noted2`.
You can move this file wherever you like (ensure that you add that location to $PATH).
